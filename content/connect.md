## We operate in small, mono focus, projects*.

All the volunteers contribute freely expecting acknowledgment for their effort and offering quality time. Generally, we team up with people and organization who understand and share the manifesto. Being proactive in developing an idea is extra appreciated, as per Autumn 2019, we run understaffed and underfunded. We don't have solutions for these issues yet.

**We can't accept volunteers!** Not because we don't need them, but because we don't have simple tasks to delegate. All the tasks here requires some form of expertise and self-management.

We can only accept a proactive proposal from independent individuals. Therefore, if in the projects below, you feel you can do anything meaningful, connect with us, your help would be appreciated.

We don't have yet a defined code of conduct, rules of engagement. In this phase, if someone has any *practical* help to offer, the best way is to reach out in our [mattermost channel](https://chat.securitywithoutborders.org/community/channels/trackingexposed), or write an email: *support* at *tracking* dot *exposed*
