### We operate in small, monofocus, projects\*. All the volunteers contribute freely expecting acknowledgemet for their effort and offering quality time. Generally a we team up with people and organization who understand and share the manifesto. Being proactive in developing an idea is extra appreciated, as per Autumn 2019 we run understaffed.

\* Each one has something different and your input might be more appropriate in their 'contact page':

We don't have yet a defined code of conduct, rules of engagement, logics and privacy assessment on how to integrate people in the project. As much as we can **data are separated from every working process**. In this phase, if someone has any *practical* help to offer to the project, the best way is to reach out in our [mattermost channel](https://chat.securitywithoutborders.org/community/channels/trackingexposed), or write an email: *support* at *tracking* dot *exposed*
