## 1. All the data collected so far in pornhub.tracking.exposed is lost.

## 2. All the data collected so far in amazon.tracking.exposed is lost.

## 3. All the historyical data (metadata, the HTMLs were already deleted) from facebook.tracking.exposed is lost.

## 4. eu19.tracking.exposed and elezioni.tracking.exposed are no longer operative.

## 5. amazon.tracking.exposed and pornhub.tracking.exposed are interrupted from operation until restored.
