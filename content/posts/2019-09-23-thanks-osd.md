a memory:

After EndSummerCamp Luca reach out to me briefly, after the presentation of fbtrex. Andrea Raimondi begin to listen and guide me (Claudio) in the very first phases of the project.
we planned the alpha release, the text in the homepage was written by Andrea with my inputs.
The 3rd of November 2016, I was so excited was when Luca Corsato, from [opensensorsdata (OSD)](https://osd.tools), sent to me the logo he design!
