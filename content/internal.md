### Dear friend! If you did something for tracking.exposed: cool! Sadly, your effort is not over yet, until your action gets adequately reported in our production list.
The file is of â€˜analysis-and-publicationâ€™! our list of projectâ€™s success and yours should be there too.
We should save each advocacy effort. Articles published that talk about us, and of course our productions.

**You've to edit** (or propose a pull request) to [this file on github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracking-exposed/facebook.tracking.exposed/master/content/analysis-and-publications.md), which [become like a list of events](https://facebook.tracking.exposed/analysis-and-publications/) in the end.

As you can see, each entry has this format:

```
resource
  kind="article"
  title="Facebook's Algorithm Shapes Our Lives. This Hacker Wants to Find Out How."
  when="July"  
  nature="external"
  author="Alex Fanta"
  authorLink="https://netzpolitik.org/author/alexander-fanta/"
  description="Netzpolitik interview to Claudio Agosti on the Tracking Exposed project and plan"
  href="https://netzpolitik.org/2019/facebooks-algorithm-shapes-our-lives-this-hacker-wants-to-find-out-how/#spendenleiste"
```

and it gets automatically formatted to look like this:

### Please ask yourself how the event/publication should looks like (it is not just OK copy paste the abstract ;) )

You don't need to put every line. for example, author and authorLink shouldn't happen often, they are meant for person OUTSIDE of the project. The speaker/project member, should go in the description.

### How many entry you should provide?

* Each advocacy moment needs a a dedicated entry. For example, in the winter school, the final report and the final presentation should be separated entries.
* In a conference, event + talk are all the same. In general, there is only one content link per entry.

### Should I append my thing even if wasn't facebook related?

Yes, we'll have a collection of articles/publication/links for each project, and the tracking.exposed will have all of them. Please don't forget to add your contributions!
