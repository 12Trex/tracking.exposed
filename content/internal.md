### Dear friend! if you did something for tracking.exposed, your effort do not really is completed until your action is not properly reported in the list 'analysis-and-publication'!

You've to edit (or propose a pull request) to [this file on github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracking-exposed/facebook.tracking.exposed/master/content/analysis-and-publications.md), which [become like a list of events](https://facebook.tracking.exposed/analysis-and-publications/) in the end.

As you can see, each entry has this format:

```
{{<resource
  kind="article"
  title="Facebook's Algorithm Shapes Our Lives. This Hacker Wants to Find Out How."
  when="July"  
  nature="external"
  author="Alex Fanta"
  authorLink="https://netzpolitik.org/author/alexander-fanta/"
  description="Netzpolitik interview to Claudio Agosti on the Tracking Exposed project and plan"
  href="https://netzpolitik.org/2019/facebooks-algorithm-shapes-our-lives-this-hacker-wants-to-find-out-how/#spendenleiste" >}}
```

You don't need to put every line. for example, author and authorLink shouldn't happen often, they are meant for person OUTSIDE of the project. The speaker/project member, should go in the description.


### How many entry you should provide?

Each advocacy moment is a different entry. In the winter school, for example, the final report and the final presentation might be separated.

In a conference, event + talk are all the same. In general, there is only one content link per entry.
