* Released the new website https://tracking.exposed :) still under review right now, but can be consider published.
* YouTube in the last revision phase, already public, most of the effort went in https://youtube.tracking.exposed/results.
* Restructuring of the new 'group' concept, we'll start to implement it on YouTube.
* Participation to [Beyond Future Design](https://www.beyond-festival.com/en/symposium/future-design/) festival. The presentation was new but without any original research.
* Tested and published the new statistics method, now for an individual project can exist configuration files like [fbtrex/trexstat.json](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/facebook/blob/refactor/config/trexstats.json) [yttrex/trexstat.json](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex/blob/master/backend/config/trexstats.json) which respectively convert the statistics in c3js.org graphs on the respective *impact pages* [fbtrex/impact](https://testing.tracking.exposed/impact) and [yttrex/impact](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/impact).
  * please note: the links above might work only in the next few weeks, because the *testing* server would become stable, and the link to the *refactor* branch should be merged in master ASAP.
* Observe with more and more frequency complaints on how is annoying twitter displaying unrequested people.
