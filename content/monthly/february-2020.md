description: new fbtrex reality-check and collaborative test results!
---

* In regards of [facebook.tracking.exposed](https://facebook.tracking.exposed), it is available browser extension v2.0. New adopters get a splash screen on the first Facebook access, old adopters, should notice a logo upgrade. Surprisingly, despite we weren't provide many updates on fbtrex, we see a constant curiosity from the internet (press on the months button to see wider). This work has been done by [Alberto Granzotto](https://twitter.com/@vrde), also as the first browser extension, and would help us in supporting more platforms.

* The new extension also gives you access to the 'reality-check' page, which is more informative now. It offers you daily aggregated information on the session you made and allow you a basic consultation and filtering of the content Facebook pick for you.

* We released the results for [potest#1](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/final-1), or check it out our [potest1 slides](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/slides/potest1).

* There are **two planned events in Milan, on March**: [Friday 13 of March](http://www.latobmilano.it/2020/02/13-3-tracking-exposed/), and [Sunday 15 of March](https://unit.abbiamoundominio.org/blog/2020-03-15-lost-potrex.html), and one **conference, in Padova, the end of March**.

* Announcement of [potest#2](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/2), and [wetest#1](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/wetest/1), the first collaborative test of Youtube!

* We struggle with fundraising: no context, just this ðŸ¤·
