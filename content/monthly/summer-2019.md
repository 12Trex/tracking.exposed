# In the summer we were at our peak with people hired for ALEX project. This proven to be quite an hard task, because we have to onboard the new collaborators, and be clear in our task specification.

* We have a new brand and style! It should be more organic and has proved value to talk with people in communication sector.
* We contribute to our first Datathon, organized with berlin Data Science Social Good. Data scientists analyzed one year of fbtrex data. We did a privacy assessment and defined minimization and confidentiality agreement; the analysts worked as a collaborator of the project, and we described restrictions in time, usage, and publication of such data. It is something that, ideally, might be enhanced by providing synthetic data and then applying the same code in our production database. They analyzed a copy of the year 2018 and here there is [the final presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cv967fdfSf96NCvN6h0H5ynvw9iEcV6S4gVetlH5MlM/edit). The analysis realized were pretty interesting, and few participants stay in touch with TRex. Simply, was has been proven hard, is to integrate the scripts and tool developed in our analysis pipeline.
* YouTube analysis in the summer school has been great! currently the site is under revision and the technology still demand stability, but as alpha has produced [unique insights](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/results).
