Completed and submitted a paper made from the experiment named [weTest1](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/wetest/announcement-1). We used a variety of analysis. For example network visualization enhanced clusters and highlight patterns:

A few months ago, we had insights thanks to such kind of analysis, after a collaborative observation of pornhub [[report page, SFW](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/potest/final-1)]. The Adult site tests related content on newly uploaded videos. We reused it on YouTube. If you want a takeaway of this paragraph: **pornhub and youtube, acts differently in regarding of testing emerging contents.** This at least, with our small sample of observation-contributions, and at the harsher closeness of youtube compared to pornhub.

Apply analysis on recurring videos, and separated what's in the API, what with _unlogged_ profiles vs _logged_ profiles:
