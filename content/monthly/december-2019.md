* Social media and low traffic: we've a mailing list (low traffic), a [Mattermost channel](https://chat.securitywithoutborders.org/community/channels/trackingexposed), [twitter](https://twitter.com/trackingexposed), [fediverse / nebbia.fail](https://nebbia.fail/@TRackingEXposed), [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/personalizationalgorithm/). All of these should become harmonious and complementary! but at the moment, they are badly used.
* A documentary in the Italian national TV been aired featuring us! we produced our first analysis of [Amazon](https://amazon.tracking.exposed). If you speak italian, please skip the first 2:18 and watch the episode ["Il mondo (segreto) di Amazon"](https://www.raiplay.it/video/2019/11/petrolio-il-mondo-segreto-di-amazon-aa6d4781-bc5c-4c51-9463-c22f399797d1.html).
* This is the [Italian report](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/presentation/blob/master/amazon.tracking.exposed%20report%20Italiano%20-%201.0%20.pdf).
* We are not going to release a 2019 summary doc; *Happy new year!*
