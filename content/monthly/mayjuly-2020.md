Small aggregated May, June, July

* There were a few of progress in YouTube aria-label analysis, as is used in the format developed for [weTest1](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/wetest/1), now we can mine machine readable information from natural language strings.
* Updated Material-UI library, [enhanced youtube popup](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex/issues/16)
* Implemented a mechanism to analyze searches results from YouTube.
* Temporarily suspended facebook.tracking.exposed (a database and disk upgrade, plus the implementation of strongest auto-cleaning data policies)

_Update_: after a few days of down, database is now operative. Since this action, is active the cyclic data purge, which should be documented and display.
By checking the [fbtrax open stats page](https://facebook.tracking.exposed/impact), you can see if the system is back online.
