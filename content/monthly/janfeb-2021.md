## First CHIARO use cases.

[CHIARO](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/chiaro/start) is a series of experiments on how to compare Youtube personalize search results. We measured the distance of results with network analysis. It was released at the end of 2020, and now we released a few of the first findings.

  description=" Abstract:  This paper studies the construction of filter bubbles and political polarization under YouTube 's algorithmic personalization, in a time where the political division runs deep in the US and the 2020 election reaffirms the polarization. Using artificially generated personalized user accounts, we find that search results differ according to users' political affiliations, both in terms of the media type and political ideology of the channels suggested, showing some empirical evidence of filter bubbles' existence on YouTube, which possibly exacerbates an echo chamber behavior and enhancing political polarization in the US political debate. Project coordinated by Salvatore Romano and Davide Beraldo, Giovanni Rossetti, Leonardo Sanna  "
