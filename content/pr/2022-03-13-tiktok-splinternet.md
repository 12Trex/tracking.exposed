For immediate release

Algorithmic investigation experts Tracking Exposed have uncovered that - for the first time - a social media giant is restricting the content available to its users in a whole country at the platform level. 

Users in Russia can no longer see content from foreign media like the BBC, or from Tiktok’s biggest stars like Charlie d'Amelio. 

Tracking.Exposed’s research shows that when a user in Russia tries to access the accounts or posts from their favourite Tiktokers they are met with an empty account. This includes old content.

### “The Russian Splinternet”

Tiktok’s move is notable because it advances the “splinternet” - a term that was coined to describe how the Chinese state censors content shown to its population through blocking foreign content at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level. This time, it is not Russian ISPs who are banning content (though that is happening too) but the Tiktok platform appears to be choosing not to display global content to Russians.

This move by TikTok is in addition to the platform’s commitment announced on March 6 to suspend the publication of new videos from Russian soil. This is in response to the recent legislation imposed by the Kremlin, which provides for penalties of up to up to fifteen years in prison for journalists as well as for individuals, Russians or foreigners, who disseminate "false information about the army". However, TikTok did not announce that they would be filtering foreign content as Tracking.Exposed’s research uncovered.

At the time of sending Tiktok has not clarified why this is happening.
Interestingly, Tracking.Exposed’s research also shows that Russian opposition accounts and content are still available.

### Tracking.Exposed’s tools to monitor social media at scale

Tracking.Exposed’s automated infrastructure analyzes the behavior of TikTok's recommendation algorithm in different countries, using VPNs [tools that allow users to make it seem like they are in different location] and a network of residential IP addresses. In this investigation, navigation by VPN or residential IP addresses in Russia returned the same results.

Marc Faddoul, co-director of Tracking.Exposed and leading AI researcher affiliated with UC Berkeley comments:

“We are witnessing an unprecedented fracture of a global social network, which now shows completely different content bases between Russia and the rest of the world. Our data proves that we have a Russian Splinternet at the platform level for the first time, restricting free flowing information to the Russian people. ”

Claudio Agosti, founder and co-director of Tracking.Exposed and privacy activist comments:

It has never been more important to shine a light on the decisions of the social media platforms, and to hold them accountable for the impact their algorithms have on our world today. We are stepping up our work and looking for collaborators, funders and volunteers to help us scale this important work.”

Tracking.Exposed collaborators at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) comment:

“State-controlled media outlets, such as RT [formerly Russia Today], Sputnik and RIA Novosti are active on TikTok and have used the platform to publish and promote Russian disinformation stories linked to Ukraine, before and after the invasion. It is clear that TikTok is a crucial element of the Kremlin's disinformation apparatus."

### Algorithmic accountability since 2016

This latest report is part of Tracking.Exposed’s commitment to bring transparency to the impact of social media algorithms, and to build tools to build a truly free internet. Tracking.Exposed currently investigates YouTube, Amazon, Facebook and PornHub, and their reports have been featured in the New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, and in United Nation reports and a letter from the US Congress to YouTube. 

Notes to Editors:

Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) is a laboratory which has studied the propaganda activity on this social network in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.
