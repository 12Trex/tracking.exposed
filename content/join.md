## 🤔  Why join the experiment? 


###### To unveil toghether how Youtube influences the public perception and society. Filter bubbles exist, and we can measure them. We can't trust offical API for independent research.



## 🥺  Are you collecting my data? 


###### No, we analyze YouTube and its behaviour. If you are paranoid and nerd enough you can use our [magic bots](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex/tree/master/methodology).


## 📅  When will the next collective experiment happen? 


###### Beginning of November: Youtube Algorithm and Climate, more info coming soon.


## 👩‍🚀  What am I supposed to do? 


###### Get the browser extension and follow the instructions of the experiment you want to participate on.

## 🤓  Can I see previous results? 


###### [weTest#1](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/slides/wetest1/#slide=1) was our first collective test about Covid19 in different languages.



## 🤩  I can't participate but I would like to support you!
