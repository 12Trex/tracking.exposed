<h2>About Us</h2>
<div class="mb-5">
    <p>Our vision is to increase transparency behind personalization
    algorithms, so that people can have more effective control of their
    online experience and more awareness of the information to
    which they are exposed.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to help researchers assess how current filtering
    mechanisms work and how personalization algorithms should be modified in
    order to minimize the dangerous social effects.</p>

<h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
<div class="mb-5">
    <blockquote>"Our main objective is to put a spotlight on users' tracking, profiling,
    on the data market and on the influence of algorithms. As long as these
    phenomena are shielded from view or understood only by experts, they cannot
    be tackled with the political determination that problems of such magnitude
    deserve. That is why we strive to explain the issue, test and promote new
    solutions, developed to benefit the community..."</blockquote>
