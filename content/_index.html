        <h2>Our manifesto</h2>
        <blockquote>Our main objective is to put a spotlight on users' tracking, profiling,
        on the data market and on the influence of algorithms. As long as these
        phenomena are shielded from view or understood only by experts, they cannot
        be tackled with the political determination that problems of such magnitude
        deserve. That is why we strive to explain the issue, test and promote new
        solutions, developed to benefit the community.</blockquote>
